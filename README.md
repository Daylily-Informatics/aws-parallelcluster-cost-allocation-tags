## Cost allocation tags with AWS ParallelCluster

With high performance computing (HPC) workloads running on AWS, users can effortlessly scale their workloads up and down and select from the wide variety of instances that AWS offers. With all of this additional flexibility, elasticity, and scale, it could seem daunting at first to track your costs and resource utilization for specific projects or users in HPC environments. However, thanks to orchestration tools such as AWS ParallelCluster (https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster) in conjunction with AWS Cost Explorer (https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) and AWS Budgets (https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/), it’s easy to manage cost allocation, forecast spending, set up billing alarms that trigger on defined budget thresholds, and analyze your usage to reduce costs or optimize price/performance. Using tags, I’ll show how all of this can be done not only at the level of your AWS account, but also for specific projects or users.
